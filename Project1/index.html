            Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R.
            Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral
            vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal.
            His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.

          <li>
            [40] On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which
            was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam
            for the post of President,[41][42] and both the Samajwadi Party and
            the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[43][44] After
            the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose
            not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.
          </li>
          <li>
            [45] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature: I am really
            overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have
            been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to
            the people of the country at this juncture.[46] The President Kalam
            authorising the Prime Minister designate Manmohan Singh to form the
            next Government in New Delhi on 19 May 2004 On 18 June, Kalam filed
            his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by
            Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
          </li>
          <li>
            [47] The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July
            2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media
            claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's
            victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18
            July.[48] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India
            in an easy victory,[49] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after
            he was sworn in on 25 July.
          </li>
          <li>
            [50] Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured
            with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before
            becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir
            Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later
            became the President of India.[51] He was also the first scientist
            and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.
